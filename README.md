# FOSSopedia
My collection of FOSS apps/software I have been come across/use.

For those that are new, FOSS stands for (Free Open Source Software).

Free does not mean you simply do not have to pay for it (free as in free beer), Free in the FOSS circle means free speach. This means that no matter your intentions for the software you are free to use it however you want.

Unfortunately, this means bad actors as well, but those are a small percentage of people who use FOSS apps/software. This should not discourage you from taking advantage of the software that these genius minds are providing to the masses. 

Free Open Source software is importsant, especially with govt oversight becoming more aggressive in technology as time goes on. Free Open Source software allows for more autonomy over big brother and their plans, whatever they may be, and allows one to use software more privately. 

FOSS apps allow more people to review the code and can potentially make changes to the software when they see holes in the softwares security. 

As time goes on and I learn more about FOSS I will be adding more to this README and to the lists I make. Feel free to put me on game when you see something is missing or incorrect.

Lets start with iOS devices


**Before I go into it, it is important to remember that these are the apps I use, there are many others I'm sure I wont mention. These are also apss youll be able to run FOR FREE with minimal fuss. 

Browsers:

- OnionBrowser
- Firefox
- DuckDuckGo
- Brave Browser

Important to note that, to quote the OnionBrowser website regarding iOS browsers "Apple requires all web browser apps to use the same core web rendering ending, called UIWebKit or WKWebView. Due to this limitation, we are unable to compile and include our own web engine, based on Firefox Gecko, that other browsers, like Tor Browser on Desktop and Android, are allowed to do."

They also go into more detail [here](https://github.com/OnionBrowser/OnionBrowser/wiki/Traffic-that-leaks-outside-of-Tor-due-to-iOS-limitations)

VPN:

- ProtonVPN
- Orbot

Both of these VPNs are free, Protonmail VPN does require a PM account, which is free to set up, Orbot does not require ANYTHING for sign up whic I enjoy for privacy reasons. Orbot does not, however, allow you to choose your server the same way a typical VPN would. 

Notes:

- Standard Notes (maybe my favorite app of them all)
- Joplin

Both of these services are cross platform making it super simple to start a note and continue it on another device for ease of movement. Both of these also use encryption for added safety. Your thoughts are yours.

E-mail:

- ProtonMail
- Tutanota

These are alternate email providers apart from the typical Gmail, iCloud, etc. Both PM and tutanota are open source and come with calendars (protonmail does not have a ios calendar app yet but does come with a free-ish vpn)

As far as privacy, E-mail isnt private so don't even try it! Always assume someone at a 3 letter agency can read your emails. Thats a discussion for another time. 

Messaging:

- Signal
- Session

A lot of folks with tell you that telegram is also an option but they aren't FOSS as far as I know, they do have some open source clients though, DENIED!

With regard to privacy, mobile is a nightmare compared to desktop/laptops but this is simply to showcase the FOSS pass I use on my iOS device for those looking to incorporate some FOSS into their iPhone.
