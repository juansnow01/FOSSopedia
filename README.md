# FOSSopedia
My collection of FOSS apps/software I have been come across/use.

For those that are new, FOSS stands for (Free Open Source Software).

Free does not mean you simply do not have to pay for it (free as in free beer), Free in the FOSS circle means free speach. This means that no matter your intentions for the software you are free to use it however you want.

Unfortunately, this means bad actors as well, but those are a small percentage of people who use FOSS apps/software. This should not discourage you from taking advantage of the software that these genius minds are providing to the masses. 

Free Open Source software is importsant, especially with govt oversight becoming more aggressive in technology as time goes on. Free Open Source software allows for more autonomy over big brother and their plans, whatever they may be, and allows one to use software more privately. 

FOSS apps allow more people to review the code and can potentially make changes to the software when they see holes in the softwares security. 

As time goes on and I learn more about FOSS I will be adding more to this README and to the lists I make. Feel free to put me on game when you see something is missing or incorrect.
