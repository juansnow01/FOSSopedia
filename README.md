# FOSSopedia
My collection of FOSS apps/software I have come across/use.

For those that are new, FOSS stands for (Free Open Source Software) which means all their code is out in the open and anyone can view it and critique it. This is the complete opposite to proprietary software which wont let you see shit, so they could put anything in there, which can and has happened, that can be bad for the user but good for the company (they're spying on you)...

Free does not mean you simply do not have to pay for it (free as in free beer), Free in the FOSS circle means free speach. This means that no matter your intentions for the software you are free to use it however you want.

Unfortunately, this means bad actors as well, but those are a small percentage of people who use FOSS apps/software. This should not discourage you from taking advantage of the software that these genius minds are providing to the masses. 

Free Open Source Software is important, especially with govt oversight becoming more aggressive in technology as time goes on. Free Open Source software allows for more autonomy over big brother and their plans, whatever they may be, and allows one to use software more privately. 

FOSS apps allow more people to review the code and can potentially make changes to the software when they see holes in the softwares security. 

There is essentially a FOSS version of any software you use depending on your operating system, but I do not use 100% free open source software, I'm just both not there yet and some software doesnt run as well as some proprietary versions. 

As time goes on and I learn more about FOSS I will be adding more to this README and to the lists I make. Feel free to put me on game when you see something is missing or incorrect.

# Lets start with iOS devices


### Before I go into it, it is important to remember that these are the apps I use/have used before, there are many others I'm sure I wont mention. These are also apss youll be able to run FOR FREE with minimal fuss. Some do have paid subscriptions, but are still FOSS. 

## Browsers:

- [OnionBrowser](https://onionbrowser.com/)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/)
- [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/app)
- [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/)

Important to note that, to quote the OnionBrowser website regarding iOS browsers "Apple requires all web browser apps to use the same core web rendering ending, called UIWebKit or WKWebView. Due to this limitation, we are unable to compile and include our own web engine, based on Firefox Gecko, that other browsers, like Tor Browser on Desktop and Android, are allowed to do."

They also go into more detail [here](https://github.com/OnionBrowser/OnionBrowser/wiki/Traffic-that-leaks-outside-of-Tor-due-to-iOS-limitations)

## VPN:

- [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/)
- [Orbot](https://orbot.app/)

Both of these VPNs are free, Protonmail VPN does require a PM account, which is free to set up [here](https://protonmail.com/signup), Orbot does not require ANYTHING for sign up whic I enjoy for privacy reasons. Orbot does not, however, allow you to choose your server the same way a typical VPN would. 

## Notes:

- [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.com/) (maybe my favorite app of them all)
- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)

Both of these services are cross platform making it super simple to start a note and continue it on another device for ease of movement. Both of these also use encryption for added safety. Your thoughts are yours.

## E-mail:

- [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/)
- [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/)

These are alternate email providers apart from the typical Gmail, iCloud, etc. Both PM and tutanota are open source and come with calendars (protonmail does not have a ios calendar app yet but does come with a free-ish vpn)

As far as privacy, E-mail isnt private so don't even try it! Always assume someone at a 3 letter agency can read your emails. Thats a discussion for another time. 

## Messaging:

- [Signal](https://signal.org/en/)
- [Session](https://getsession.org/)

A lot of folks with tell you that telegram is also an option but they aren't FOSS as far as I know, they do have some open source clients though, DENIED!

With regard to privacy, mobile is a nightmare compared to desktop/laptops but this is simply to showcase the FOSS apps I use on my iOS device for those looking to incorporate some FOSS into their iPhone. 

# ...Now lets look at MacOS

MacOS, desktops/laptopns in general are going to have more options by default. Whether you are using MacOS, Windows or Linux you're going to have way more options over mobile operating systems. I run both MacOS and Linux (on a different machine) lately I have been leaning more towards Linux as my favorite OS but still use my macbook daily. If you want to see what pros Linux has vs MacOS check out this [article.](https://itsfoss.com/linux-vs-mac/)

## Browsers:

Browsers on macOS are plenty, there are so many, I think the one browser I have not tried is one called LibreWolf only because it's not available for MacOS at the minute but I currently use three (3) browsers but have experimented with others

- [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/)
- [Ungoogled-Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/)
- [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/)

Tor Browser is a privacy focuse browser by the [tor project](https://www.torproject.org/), TOR stands for "The Onion Router" because of its onion routing netowrk in which they run you through a few relays before you land on the web page you are looking for. More can be read [here](https://www.torproject.org/about/history/)

Chromium is a browser brought to you by the same folks who contributed to Google Chrome and ChromeOS, Chromium is the open source project and runs just as smooth as chrome and has pretty much all of the bells and whistles as chrome, you can read more about them [here](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/). There is also a more privacy focused version called Ungoogled-Chromium whichs runs pretty much as a fork of Chromium minus any Google services for those lookiung to get completely away from the beast, I could never find a site but here is their [GitHub](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium).

Brave is popular with a lot of folks but I could never get around to using it long term, from what I've read it is very privacy focused, something about it just didnt work for me.

Firefox is one I have been using since I started migrating to open source software, it was my daily driver browser for over a year and still I use it for a lot of stuff, there are so many extensions and themes so making it comfy/personal will not be a problem, making it privacy focused is no problem at all either with add ons like [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) and [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere), overall if you're used to Safari getting comfortable with any browser is going to be a challenge, but you are pretty spoiled for choice compared to mobile devices. 

## Productivity:

- [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.com/) 
- [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)

Standard Notes is by far my favorite app since learning about open source software, I have it on all of my devices, I still use my notes app on my iPhone but not so much on my MacBook, I just enjoy it a lot more, you can also use Standard notes on its web version but I prefer the standalone app for when I dont have wifi I can still access any notes I may need.

LibreOffice is the FOSS world's take on Microsoft office, not entirely sure which one came first, but it comes with everything youd need to create/edit documents. You can check it out yourself [here](https://www.libreoffice.org/). They are also featured on this list of [Best Open Source Software](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/best-open-source-software).

## VPN:

- [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/)
- [MullvadVPN](https://mullvad.net/en/)

As stated in the iOS section ProtonVPN requires a ProtonMail account, which is free to set up, out the box you get 3 servers (Japan, Netherlands and USA, mullvad is different where, its not free and you dont sign up with any personally identifable information, when you sign up they give you a string of numbers and that is your account, you can aslo pay for Mullvad with Bitcoin or Monero for added privacy. 

## Media

- [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)
- [FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io/)

VLC I am sure many of you have seen before without realizing it, its logo is just an orange traffic cone, whenever I plug my external hard drive in and want to listen to some of the music on it or watch any of the movies on it I play it off VLC, it's just an app I always have had without realizing it was open source (because I didnt even know FOSS was a thing at the time).

FreeTube is a Youtube front-end, meaning its the vehicle that helps you navigate YouTube privately, it allows you to subscribe, download, like/dislike etc. They detail their privacy policy [here](https://freetubeapp.io/privacy.php).

## Messaging:

- [Session](getsession.org)
- [Signal](https://signal.org/en/)

Both Signal and Session offer end to end encryption (E2EE), the key difference between the two is Session does not require a phone number, instead it gives each use a unique key which is then protected by a recovery phrase. Another big difference is that there is a 99.9999% chance that NO ONE you know uses Session, whereas you probably know some people who use Signal. From a privacy standpoint everyone should be using apps like these becasue they encrypt EVERY message/call so they couldnt snoop even if they wanted to. that is very impotant. 

To summarize the MacOS portion, I am sure I missed 100's of apps that some people would find useful, let me know and I can add them for others to look into. I focused on these two because majority of the people I know use either iOS or MacOS devices, most times both. This guide is tailored to people who want to start walking back all the proprietary software built into these machines.
