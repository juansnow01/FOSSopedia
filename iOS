In this section I will detail the iOS apps I use that are FOSS:

**Before I go into it, it is important to remember that these are the apps I use, there are many others I'm sure I wont mention. These are also apss youll be able to run FOR FREE with minimal fuss. 

Browsers:

- OnionBrowser
- Firefox
- DuckDuckGo
- Brave Browser

Important to note that, to quote the OnionBrowser website regarding iOS browsers "Apple requires all web browser apps to use the same core web rendering ending, called UIWebKit or WKWebView. Due to this limitation, we are unable to compile and include our own web engine, based on Firefox Gecko, that other browsers, like Tor Browser on Desktop and Android, are allowed to do."

They also go into more detail here: https://github.com/OnionBrowser/OnionBrowser/wiki/Traffic-that-leaks-outside-of-Tor-due-to-iOS-limitations

VPN:

- ProtonVPN
- Orbot

Both of these VPNs are free, Protonmail VPN does require a PM account, which is free to set up, Orbot does not require ANYTHING for sign up whic I enjoy for privacy reasons. Orbot does not, however, allow you to choose your server the same way a typical VPN would. 

Notes:

- Standard Notes (maybe my favorite app of them all)
- Joplin

Both of these services are cross platform making it super simple to start a note and continue it on another device for ease of movement. Both of these also use encryption for added safety. Your thoughts are yours.

E-mail:

- ProtonMail
- Tutanota

These are alternate email providers apart from the typical Gmail, iCloud, etc. Both PM and tutanota are open source and come with calendars (protonmail does not have a ios calendar app yet but does come with a free-ish vpn)

As far as privacy, E-mail isnt private so don't even try it! Always assume someone at a 3 letter agency can read your emails. Thats a discussion for another time. 

Messaging:

- Signal
- Session

A lot of folks with tell you that telegram is also an option but they aren't FOSS as far as I know, they do have some open source clients though, DENIED!
